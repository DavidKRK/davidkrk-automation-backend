## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a potential security issue in this project, please notify
AWS/Amazon Security via the [vulnerability reporting page](https://aws.amazon.com/security/vulnerability-reporting/).
Please do **not** create a public GitHub issue.

## Temporary Audit Exceptions

This repository enforces CI blocking for **high/critical direct vulnerabilities**.

One temporary exception is currently tracked in:
- `.github/security/audit-exceptions.json`

Current accepted risk:
- `brace-expansion` via `aws-cdk-lib` is transitive in the build/tooling chain.
- It is treated as **non-exploitable in production runtime** for the exposed API.

Exception lifecycle requirements:
- Owner, advisory, linked issue, and expiration date are mandatory.
- Weekly monitoring checks upstream (`aws-cdk-lib`) and forces follow-up when a new version is available.
- If the targeted vulnerability disappears from audit results, the exception must be removed immediately.
- On expiry, CI fails until the exception is removed or renewed with explicit justification.
